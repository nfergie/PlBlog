Programming Languages Blog
==========================
In this repo I will be posting blog posts related to classwork in Programming Languages at Chapman University as well as the process of how I went about learning Golang (Go) and how that relates to classwork.

The posts will be in the linked HackMd.io files because they render LateX easily.

Lastly, please read in the order here as they will make most sense that way, not by date posted.

Enjoy!
