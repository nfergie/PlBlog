Programming Languages Blog
==========================
In this repo I will be posting blog posts related to classwork in Programming Languages at Chapman University as well as the process of how I went about learning Golang (Go) and how that relates to classwork.

The posts will be in the linked HackMd.io files because they render LateX easily.

Enjoy!

Many of the examples and some definitions are taken from Prof. Kurz [GitHub](https://github.com/alexhkurz/programming-languages)
