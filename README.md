Programming Languages Blog
==========================
In this repo I will be posting blog posts related to classwork in Programming Languages at Chapman University as well as the process of how I went about learning Golang (Go) and how that relates to classwork.

The posts will be in the linked HackMd.io files because they render LateX easily.

Enjoy!
